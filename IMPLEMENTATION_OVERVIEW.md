## Core Components

### 1. AIDrivenMobsPlugin (Main Class)
- Entry point for the Bukkit plugin
- Initializes all subsystems
- Manages plugin lifecycle (enable/disable)

### 2. Data Management
- **PlayerMemory**: Tracks player combat statistics and behavioral patterns
- **MobPersonality**: Stores personality traits for different mob types
- **MobMemoryManager**: Central manager for all memory-related operations
- **DataPersistenceManager**: Handles saving/loading data to/from YAML files

### 3. Event Listening
- **MobBehaviorListener**: Listens to Bukkit events to track player interactions
  - Tracks damage dealt to mobs
  - Records player kills
  - Monitors potion consumption
  - Manages player join/quit events

### 4. Adaptive AI Behaviors
- **CustomMobGoal**: Base class for all custom mob AI goals
- **WaitForShieldDownGoal**: Creeper behavior to wait for player shield breaks
- **SquadFormationGoal**: Skeleton behavior to form tactical squads

### 5. Villager Trust System
- **VillagerTrustSystem**: Manages trust relationships between players and villagers
- Tracks positive/negative interactions
- Applies consequences based on trust levels

### 6. Command System
- **MobMemoryCommand**: Player command for viewing/resetting stats

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Player Behavior Tracking
Tracks various player statistics:
- Melee hits vs. ranged hits
- Shield blocks
- Potion usage
- Kill counts by mob type

### 2. Mob Personality System
Assigns personality traits to mob types:
- Creepers: ambusher, coward
- Skeletons: brave, squad_member
- Zombies: relentless, pack_hunter

### 3. Adaptive Mob Behaviors
- **Creepers** adapt based on player shield usage
- **Skeletons** form squads when facing melee players
- **Villagers** develop trust relationships that can turn to betrayal

### 4. Data Persistence
- YAML-based storage for player statistics
- Automatic loading on player join
- Automatic saving on player quit/server shutdown

## Technical Approach

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture
The plugin uses Bukkit's event system to track player interactions without modifying core game mechanics.

### 2. Memory-Based Decision Making
Mobs make decisions based on accumulated knowledge about player behavior patterns.

### 3. Extensible Design
The system is designed to easily add new mob behaviors and personality traits.

## Implementation Notes

### Bukkit Dependencies
This plugin requires the Spigot API (v1.16.5) to compile and run. The Maven configuration in `pom.xml` specifies these dependencies.

### NMS Integration
For full AI modification capabilities, integration with Minecraft's NMS (Net Minecraft Server) would be required. This implementation provides a framework that could be extended with NMS integration.

### Performance Considerations
- Data is cached in memory for quick access
- File I/O is minimized through batch operations
- Event listeners are optimized to only process relevant events

## Future Enhancements

1. **Global AI Memory**: Boss mobs that learn across the entire server
2. **Whispers System**: Villagers spreading gossip about players
3. **Adaptive Raids**: Pillagers changing tactics based on player behavior
4. **Database Support**: MySQL/SQLite backend for larger servers
5. **Machine Learning**: More sophisticated behavior prediction algorithms

## Deployment

1. Compile using Maven: `mvn clean package`
2. Copy the generated JAR to the server's `plugins` directory
3. Restart the server
4. Player data will be stored in `plugins/AIDrivenMobs/playerdata/`

## Commands

- `/mobmemory stats` - View your combat statistics
- `/mobmemory reset` - Reset your combat statistics
